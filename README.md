# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Exillite!
My name is Alexander Rodinov.

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer.
I have experience in commercial application development in C# (.net), Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI) and Java (Android).
I am quite familiar with web frontend technologies.
I have a lot of experience with the deployment of applications and the development of tools for this.


Currently, I am engaged in a startup outsourcing development.
I collaborate with people who dont have enough experience and knowledge. 
Our team helps them get it: they are trained with mentoring and we find them real projects.

If you want to work with us or you have commercial offers, write to me - alexander@rodionov.space
